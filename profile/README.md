I'm [@igorlamos](https://github.com/igorlamos), the creator of [beplus.cloud](https://beplus.cloud) â€“ the _Build Ecosystem_ designed to help developers and companies bring their software product visions to life.

[beplus.training](https://beplus.training) is a collection of playbooks and video tutorials to guide you on your software product development journey, no matter where you're at.

I'm helping companies build their products for years. I've witnessed countless struggles and patterns in the industry that have inspired me to create an all-in-one resource for your needs. But I didn't stop at just creating the [product](https://beplus.cloud) itself. I knew there was more I could offer to help you truly excel. That's why I've designed a comprehensive training program that will not only teach you how to use [beplus.cloud](https://beplus.cloud), but also why it's been designed the way it is, and how to unleash its full potential. Whether you're just starting out or looking to take your skills to the next level, [beplus.training](https://beplus.training) is your ultimate guide to success.

## Where to start? ðŸš€

There's still some work I have to do before launching. I expect the next launch to happen in Q2 2023.
